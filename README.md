# Solo Awakening LLM Lab

An HTML5 canvas playground of mini-games that teach core concepts of large language models.

## Mini-Games

### Token Town — Tokenization Basics
- Click between letters in **TRANSFORMER** to add or remove token boundaries.
- Each cut increases the token count; keep tokens under the budget to succeed.

### Attention Arena — Attention Mechanism
- The words *THE QUICK BROWN FOX* are laid out on the field.
- Rotate the query vector with the slider until the attention weight on **FOX** reaches 0.60 or higher.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose a mini-game from the menu.
3. Follow the on-screen goals to explore how tokenization and attention work.

This project turns abstract LLM ideas into hands-on puzzles for intuitive learning.
