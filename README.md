# Solo Awakening LLM Game

A small HTML5 canvas game that introduces the basic steps of building a tiny language model.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Use the arrow keys to move the blue square.
3. Collect all green tokens. Each token explains a step in building a language model.
4. After collecting every token, a tiny bigram model is trained on a small sample of text and generates new text.

This project is a playful way to understand concepts like data collection, tokenization, training, and text generation.
