# Solo Awakening LLM Lab

An HTML5 canvas playground of mini-games that teach core concepts of large language models. The lab now sports a dark, purple theme and celebratory effects to make learning feel playful.

## Mini-Games

### Token Town — Tokenization Basics
- Click between letters in **TRANSFORMER** to add or remove token boundaries.
- Colored blocks show each token, and confetti rains down when you meet the budget.
- Each cut increases the token count; keep tokens under the budget to score.

### Attention Arena — Attention Mechanism
- The words *THE QUICK BROWN FOX* are laid out on the field.
- Rotate the query vector with the slider until the attention weight on **FOX** reaches 0.60 or higher.
- Lines from the query vector to each word thicken based on attention, and success triggers confetti.

## How to Play
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Choose a mini-game from the menu and return with **Back to Menu**.
3. Follow the on-screen goals to explore how tokenization and attention work while chasing a high score.

This project turns abstract LLM ideas into hands-on puzzles for intuitive learning.
